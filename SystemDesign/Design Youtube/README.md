# YouTube System Design

YouTube is a video sharing and streaming platform that allows users to upload, view, and share videos. The system must handle video uploads, encoding and transcoding, video storage, streaming to millions of viewers, recommendations, comments, and analytics. Key challenges include processing and storing massive video files, delivering high-quality streaming with low latency, handling concurrent viewers, providing personalized recommendations, and scaling to serve billions of video views daily.
