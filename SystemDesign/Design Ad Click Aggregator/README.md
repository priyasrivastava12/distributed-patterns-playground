# Ad Click Aggregator System Design

An Ad Click Aggregator is a system designed to collect, process, and aggregate click data from online advertisements in real-time. This system must handle massive volumes of click events, provide real-time analytics, and support queries for aggregated metrics such as click counts by advertiser, campaign, or time period. Key challenges include handling high write throughput, ensuring data consistency, and providing low-latency queries for aggregated statistics.
