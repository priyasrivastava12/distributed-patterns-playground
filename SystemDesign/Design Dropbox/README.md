# Dropbox System Design

Dropbox is a cloud-based file storage and synchronization service that allows users to store files online and sync them across multiple devices. The system must handle file uploads, downloads, synchronization across devices, version control, and sharing capabilities. Key challenges include efficient storage, handling concurrent file modifications, ensuring data consistency, and providing fast file access with minimal latency.
