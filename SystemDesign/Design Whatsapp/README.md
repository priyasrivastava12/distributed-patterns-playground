# WhatsApp System Design

WhatsApp is a messaging application that enables users to send text messages, media files, and make voice/video calls. The system must handle real-time messaging, message delivery guarantees, group chats, media sharing, end-to-end encryption, and presence indicators. Key challenges include ensuring message delivery, handling offline users, managing group chat synchronization, supporting media uploads/downloads, maintaining low latency, and scaling to billions of users.
