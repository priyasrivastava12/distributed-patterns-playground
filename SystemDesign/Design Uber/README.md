# Uber System Design

Uber is a ride-sharing platform that connects riders with drivers. The system must handle ride requests, driver matching, real-time location tracking, route optimization, payment processing, and surge pricing. Key challenges include matching riders with nearby drivers in real-time, handling location updates efficiently, managing dynamic pricing, ensuring low-latency responses, and scaling to handle millions of concurrent ride requests globally.
