# Local Delivery Service System Design

A Local Delivery Service is a system that connects customers with local delivery providers to facilitate the delivery of goods, food, or services. The system must handle order placement, real-time tracking, driver assignment and routing, payment processing, and notifications. Key challenges include matching orders with available drivers, optimizing delivery routes, providing real-time location tracking, handling peak demand, and ensuring timely deliveries.
