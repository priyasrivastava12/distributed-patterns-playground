# Facebook Post Search System Design

Facebook Post Search is a system that enables users to search through billions of posts, comments, and content across the platform. The system must support full-text search, handle complex queries, provide relevant results, and scale to handle millions of search requests per second. Key challenges include indexing massive amounts of content, providing fast search results, handling ranking and relevance, and supporting various search filters and criteria.
