# LeetCode System Design

LeetCode is an online platform for coding practice and technical interview preparation. The system must support problem management, code submission and execution, test case validation, leaderboards, user progress tracking, and discussion forums. Key challenges include handling code execution in a secure sandbox environment, managing test cases, providing real-time feedback, and scaling to support millions of users solving problems simultaneously.
