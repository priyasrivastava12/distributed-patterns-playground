# Rate Limiter System Design

A Rate Limiter is a system component that controls the rate of requests or operations to prevent abuse, ensure fair resource usage, and maintain system stability. The system must enforce rate limits across distributed services, handle high request volumes, provide low-latency checks, and support various rate limiting algorithms (token bucket, sliding window, fixed window). Key challenges include distributed coordination, handling bursts of traffic, ensuring accuracy, and maintaining high performance.
