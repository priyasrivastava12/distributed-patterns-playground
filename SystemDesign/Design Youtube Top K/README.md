# YouTube Top K Videos System Design

YouTube Top K is a system that identifies and ranks the most popular videos based on various metrics such as views, likes, comments, and watch time. The system must aggregate engagement metrics in real-time, calculate popularity scores, maintain top K rankings, and serve these rankings efficiently. Key challenges include processing massive streams of engagement data, maintaining accurate rankings in real-time, handling time-based windows (daily, weekly, all-time), and providing low-latency queries for top K results.
