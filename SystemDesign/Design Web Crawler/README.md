# Web Crawler System Design

A Web Crawler is a system that systematically browses the World Wide Web to index web pages for search engines or data collection. The system must discover URLs, fetch web pages, parse content, extract links, respect robots.txt, handle different content types, and avoid overloading target servers. Key challenges include efficiently crawling billions of web pages, handling dynamic content, managing politeness policies, deduplication, and scaling the crawling infrastructure.
