Tinder is a location-based dating application that matches users based on proximity and preferences. The system must handle user profiles, location tracking, matching algorithms, real-time messaging, and push notifications. Key challenges include efficient location-based matching, handling real-time updates, managing user preferences and swipes, ensuring low-latency messaging, and scaling to millions of concurrent users.
