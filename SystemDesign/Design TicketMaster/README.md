# TicketMaster System Design

TicketMaster is a ticketing platform that sells tickets for events, concerts, and shows. The system must handle ticket sales, seat selection, inventory management, payment processing, and prevent overselling. Key challenges include handling flash sales with massive concurrent requests, ensuring fair ticket distribution, preventing ticket scalping, managing seat inventory accurately, and providing a smooth user experience during high-demand events.
